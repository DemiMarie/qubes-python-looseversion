Description: Version numbering for anarchists and software realists
 A backwards/forwards-compatible fork of distutils.version.LooseVersion, for
 times when PEP-440 isn't what you need.
 .
 The goal of this package is to be a drop-in replacement for the original
 LooseVersion. It implements an identical interface and comparison logic to
 LooseVersion. The only major change is that a looseversion.LooseVersion is
 comparable to a distutils.version.LooseVersion, which means tools should not
 need to worry whether all dependencies that use LooseVersion have migrated.
